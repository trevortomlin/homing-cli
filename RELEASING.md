# Releasing homing-cli

Releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Before 1.0, a minor version may
change commands, flags, output or exit codes; a patch version must not.

1. Make sure `main` is green and the Dependabot PRs are handled. If homing-format has a new
   release, update the tag in `Cargo.toml` and run `cargo update -p homing-format`.
2. Update `version` in `Cargo.toml` (and `Cargo.lock` with `cargo check`).
3. In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, add a new empty
   `## [Unreleased]`, and update the links at the bottom.
4. Update the version in the README's install instructions.
5. Commit (`chore: release vX.Y.Z`, signed off) and push. Wait for CI.
6. Tag and push the tag:

   ```sh
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "homing-cli vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

   The Release workflow builds the binaries and publishes the GitHub release, with the
   CHANGELOG section as notes. To test the builds without publishing, run the workflow
   manually ("Run workflow" on the Actions tab).
